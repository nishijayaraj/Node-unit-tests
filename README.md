# Introduction into unit testing in NodeJS with Mocha and chai

Installation
=============

#1. Install mocha as a global dependancy
    npm install -g mocha

#2. Navigate to respective folder and run npm init from terminal to generate package.json

#3. Then run following commands to add mocha and chai as depedancy in this package.json

#4. create a file named test.js. Mocha and chai will look for files with name test.js or folder test in case multiple test files are involved. This is an important concept to keep in mind.

#5.  Run the test

   From the directory where this test.js file is created open a terminal and run the following command
   mocha test.js
